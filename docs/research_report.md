# Research report - vertical scaling

## Introduction

...

## Problem statement

## Goal of the research

The goal of this research should provide insights on how to ensure vertical scaling performance of the non-functionals are met while dealing with the 100.000 concurrent users target.

## Scope and time estimation

The scope of the research is limited to finding out the target performance vertically within the architecture defined for Spaced.

## Research questions

### Main question

How do the existing design decisions for Spaced perform when scaled up to accommodate 100.000 concurrent users working on their items collaboratively in a 2D environment, ensuring sub-second latency between user interactions, and data resiliency with no loss longer than a minute?

### Sub-questions

**Sub-question 1: How can the performance be measured of the system to find bottlenecks within the architectural choices?**
**Sub-question 2: How does the system behave under heavy loads?**
**Sub-question 3: How can Spaced be improved to reach and potentially exceed the target performance?**

## Results
