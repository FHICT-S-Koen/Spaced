# Service providers

## Introduction

Spaced is meant to be open-source to allow for self-hosting so using widely adopted open technologies and standards are essential to allow for hosting on as many providers as possible.

When experience is gained with any provider the goal is to document this process in guides that are minimal to reduce maintenance overhead, and to work towards making the process of setup as simple as possible.

## What Spaced needs for hosting

**Provider solutions**

1. Cluster management
2. Container registry
3. Blob storage
4. Eventually GPUs for inferencing
5. Scaling solutions

Therefore widely adopted cluster management is needed which kubernetes provides. Eventually the goal is to manage as much as possible in-house for tight integration, however people should also be able to integrate with further widely adopted tools that they are already familiar like S3 based object storage.
